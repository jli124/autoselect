# AutoSelect
## Motivation
There are 2 motivations for this project.
1. Auto-select the machine learning model needed automatically and rapidly
2. Predict air flight delay to reduce travelers’ frustration according to the weather condition, volume of traveler, carrier of the flights.
## Dataset
The dataset is obtained through Department of Transportation, [Report Carrier On-Time Performance](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp).The dataset contains information like time period, origin information, departure information, delay information etc. The dataset is about 70 GB covering the above information from 1987 to 2019.
